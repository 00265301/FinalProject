Final Project README

My final project is a general knwledge quiz. 
It will first ask for the users name and give a quick introduction to the quiz.
It asks the user 15 questions:
	- 1-7 are multipple choice and the rest are user input
My first 13 questions all use a dictionary to house the answers.
Question 14 uses the random module to give the user two random numbers that they must multiply.
Question 15 will open a file titled "Alone" which the user can read and then answer a question about.
The quiz keeps total of the answers and at the end will gice the total score and say goodbye.
The quiz uses an if else statement to let the user know if it is right or wrong and to keep score.

For this, the user will need the file Alone.txt

For this project my biggest issues to work though were getting the random numbers to generate and the file to open, if possible in the dictionary.
I wanted to keep all questions within the dictionary, but then decided to have two that were not.

If I had more time and more knowledge I would have liked to have more diversity in the kinds of questions, like the two that were not in the dictionary.

Works Cited
For this assignment I exclusively used the text book and the files and videos provided in the weekly modules, besides for using google to make sure my answers were correct.
Anything else I tried to search for assistance wasn't what I was looking for.
